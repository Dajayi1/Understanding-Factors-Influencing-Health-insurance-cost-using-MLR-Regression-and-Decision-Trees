# Background
This project explores various factors that influence health such as age, BMI, and various habits. This is due to the fact that health and wealth are related in many different ways which could be seen by the sheer cost of unhealthy habits.
The Centers for Disease Control estimates that a 10% weight loss could reduce an overweight person’s lifetime medical costs by $2,200 to $5,300. Delaying the onset of diabetes can save thousands of dollars annually in increased medical costs. Therefore, financial problems can affect a person’s health status and vice versa.
To better understand this topic Multiple Linear Regression and Decision Tree Models were formulated to analyse the factors influencing health such Age, BMI, Gender and others.

### Key Factors Influenicng Health Insurance Cost:
 
*Unhealthy Habits
*Financial Pressure
